# Proper Deployment Workflow for Briefing Website

## Pre-Deployment Checklist
✅ Generate all briefing files locally  
✅ Build website locally using Jekyll/GitHub Pages structure  
✅ Test all links and navigation locally  
✅ Verify responsive design and mobile compatibility  

## Quality Assurance Process
✅ Deploy to staging/production environment  
✅ **ACTUAL BROWSER TESTING** - Open and browse the live website in real browser  
✅ Verify all briefing links are accessible and functional  
✅ Check that content displays correctly with proper formatting  
✅ Confirm mobile responsiveness works properly  
✅ Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)  

## Go-Live Verification
✅ All team members' briefings are published and accessible  
✅ Main index page loads correctly with latest content  
✅ Individual briefing pages load without 404 errors  
✅ All internal links function properly  
✅ Website performance is acceptable (load time < 3 seconds)  

## Documentation Requirements
✅ Record deployment timestamp and version  
✅ Document any issues encountered during testing  
✅ Maintain screenshot evidence of successful deployment  
✅ Update deployment logs with verification results  

## Failure Response Protocol
❌ If any step fails, DO NOT declare go-live  
❌ Roll back to previous working version if necessary  
❌ Fix root cause before attempting redeployment  
❌ Implement additional testing for the specific failure point  

## Key Principle
**Never assume deployment is successful - always verify through actual browser testing before declaring go-live.**
