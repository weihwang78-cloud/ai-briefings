# MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW PROCEDURES

## Purpose
Establish clear management processes that separate operational oversight from technical implementation, ensuring proper quality standards and team accountability.

## Core Principles

### 1. Role Separation
- **Operations Manager (PS-008)**: Focus on process, quality standards, and team coordination
- **Software Developer (PS-005)**: Handle all technical implementation and deployment issues  
- **Domain Specialists**: Own content quality in their respective domains
- **Quality Checker (PS-006)**: Independent verification of all deliverables

### 2. Pre-Deployment Verification
- Never declare go-live without complete end-to-end testing
- All deployments require browser-based verification by Operations Manager
- Technical issues must be escalated to Software Developer before go-live decisions

### 3. Quality Gate Process
- **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria**: All components must pass quality checks
- **Escalation Protocol**: Technical issues → Software Developer immediately
- **Communication Standards**: Only communicate go-live after full verification

## Standard Operating Procedures

### A. Deployment Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Content generation verified (all team members)
- [ ] Local website build successful  
- [ ] Browser testing completed (all pages functional)
- [ ] Link validation passed (no broken links)
- [ ] User experience verified (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] Technical deployment confirmed by Software Developer
- [ ] Quality Checker approval obtained

### B. Go-Live Decision Process
1. **Pre-Deployment Review**: Operations Manager verifies all checklist items
2. **Technical Validation**: Software Developer confirms deployment readiness  
3. **Quality Assurance**: Quality Checker validates final deliverables
4. **Go/No-Go Decision**: Only proceed if ALL criteria are met
5. **Post-Deployment Verification**: Confirm live site functionality within 15 minutes

### C. Issue Escalation Protocol
- **Technical Issues**: Immediately escalate to Software Developer (PS-005)
- **Content Quality Issues**: Escalate to relevant Domain Specialist
- **Process Failures**: Operations Manager implements corrective actions
- **Critical Failures**: Halt go-live until resolved

## Accountability Framework

### Operations Manager Responsibilities
- Maintain quality standards and processes
- Coordinate team activities and timelines  
- Ensure proper escalation of technical issues

### Team Member Responsibilities

- Software Developer: Resolve all technical deployment issues
- Quality Checker: Provide independent verification of all deliverables
- All Members: Report issues through proper escalation channels

## Continuous Improvement

### Process Reviews
- Weekly review of deployment processes and quality metrics
- Monthly assessment of role effectiveness and escalation efficiency  
- Quarterly update of procedures based on lessons learned

### Success Metrics
