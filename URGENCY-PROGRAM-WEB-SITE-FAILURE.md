## TRIGGER CONDITIONS
- Website returns HTTP 404 or other error codes
- GitHub Pages deployment fails
- Briefing content inaccessible via primary URL
- User reports website accessibility issues

## REQUIRED AGENTS (IMMEDIATE SPAWN)
### Primary Response Team:
- **Software Developer (PS-005)**: Technical infrastructure specialist
  - Immediate action: Resolve GitHub Pages deployment issues
  - Timeline: 2-hour resolution deadline
  - Escalation: If unresolved after 2 hours, implement emergency hosting

- **Quality Checker (PS-006)**: Independent validation specialist  
  - Immediate action: Verify alternative access methods
  - Timeline: Continuous monitoring during incident
  - Escalation: Report quality issues and compliance violations

- **Operations Manager (PS-008)**: Coordination and escalation manager
  - Immediate action: Activate urgency protocols and communicate with General Manager
  - Timeline: Immediate response upon trigger detection
  - Escalation: Coordinate all response activities and maintain stakeholder communication

## AUTOMATED RESPONSE PROTOCOLS
1. **Immediate Alternative Access**: Briefings delivered via WhatsApp until website restored
2. **Escalation Timeline**: 
   - T+0: Urgency program activated, agents spawned
   - T+2 hours: Emergency backup publishing if primary not resolved
   - T+4 hours: Full contingency plan if backup also fails
3. **Communication Protocol**: 
   - Hourly status updates to General Manager
   - Immediate notification when website restored
   - Daily post-incident review and improvement recommendations

## TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS & WORKAROUNDS

**Workaround Implementation**:
- Manual agent activation through documented procedures
- Direct escalation notifications to team members
- Emergency response checklist for Operations Manager

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- All briefings delivered to General Manager without interruption
- Quality standards maintained throughout incident
- Post-incident improvements implemented to prevent recurrence

## DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
